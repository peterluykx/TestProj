This is a test project. 
You need a settings.txt file to let this work. 

Settings.txt
path=C:\temp\Programming\C++\Project2\app.exe
id=10

The call.exe will execute the app.exe and will send to arguements with it. arg1 = id and arg2 is the one you will call.exe with. 
for example in command prompt. call.exe +44....... will execute app.exe and send the arg 10 & +44.....
